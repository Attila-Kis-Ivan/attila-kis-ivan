## Hi there 👋

My name is Attila, and I'm a Level 1 SOC Analyst / Threat Intelligence (CTI) Analyst with practical, hands-on experience gained through BTL1
training and BTLO labs. Skilled in phishing analysis, log monitoring, threat intelligence, digital forensics (DFIR), and
SIEM platforms. Background in web development with JavaScript, React, Python and Django, supporting automation, scripting, and a strong understanding of web technologies and attack surfaces relevant to SOC investigations.

- 🔭 I recently built my Active Directory home lab to gain experience on Splunk, Spkunk Universal Forwarder and Sysmon set-up and configuration. Simulating cyber attack on this system to investigate the incident and see what telmetry has been generated.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning KQL, Microsoft Sentinel, Deffender and Azure.
